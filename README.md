# Don't Drown

An immersive VR game about trying to keep yourself from drowing. Part of the 2025 exposition for the Testerep project.

## Mechanics

### Break Furniture
You can break most of the furniture to gain planks and other materials to barricade with.

### Board Windows
Once a plank is held in the correct orientation nails appear. When you punch a nail in 3 times the plank remains fixed.

### Bucket
Use a bucket to scoop up water and throw it outside.

### Climbing
Use the ladder to climb up to the second story. Make use of your handy toolbelt to put your hammer away so you have both hands free.

### Drowning
Once you go underwater a post process volume is added. As you drown a black vignette becomes smaller and smaller.
